# MA_DC_parties-and-digitalization

Data tables and charts created for the MA thesis written by Yin Nien Chiang in 2022.

The thesis covers digitalization policies in party manifetos issued by parties of the political left in the United Kingdom.
The party manifestos have been analysed with [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/). All the charts published here have been exported from Voyant.

This thesis was submitted in the MA degree programme [Digital Cultures](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/education/master/media-studies-digital-cultures) at Maastricht University.
